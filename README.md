    ```
    rules_version = '2';

    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /users/{userId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
          match /notes/{noteId} {
            allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
          }
        }
      }
